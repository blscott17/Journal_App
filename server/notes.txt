app.js is the main hub of your server because of this code: 
"main": "app.js", in package.json.

import the express engine - we are importing this from the node modules
because of this code: "express": "^4.17.1", in package.json.

create instance of express
npx nodemon  runs code must put npx in front of nodemon
Ctrl + Ctrl - stops the server
rs restarts the server

To start the server:
1) open app.js in Integrated Terminal
2) type npx nodeman
3) trashcan on terminal or closing Visual Studio also stops the server  

DATABASE NOTE:
If you have to alter a model by adding a column it will not show up in PgAdmin. In PgAdmin you must select your table - right click and drop the table. And then rerun nodemon again. 

USERCONTROLLER NOTES:
Notes
When we use require( ' dependency ' ) such as on line 1, we are importing and accessing dependencies we installed in our project. Our project's dependencies are housed in the package.json. This is a great place to check for spelling errors.
When we use require( ' . /foldername/filename ' ) such as on line 6 to access information, we are following our file structure to walk through our various folders and access the correct file or function. This is another place to check for spelling errors.
